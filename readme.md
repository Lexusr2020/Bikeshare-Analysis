# Bikeshare Peoject Using Python, Pandas & Numpy

In this project, I utilized Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answered interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also developed a script that took in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal, presenting these statistics effectively.
